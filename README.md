# Cerebral palsy (CP) study in California

This page includes all ongoing studies that use a large statewide cohort of cerebral palsy (CP) in California, aiming to investigate the prenatal exposures to environmental, social, and perinatal factors and the risk of childhood CP.


# Sample data 
To guide future research, we have prepared sample datasets for each of our published study containing aggregated counts for major variables.

- Toxic air contaminant (TAC) and CP study:
  - "TAC0515_sampledata_Demo.csv" contains aggregated statistics by birth years for major maternal demographic characteristic.
  -  "TAC0515_sampledata_Exp.csv" contains aggregated exposure levels by birth years for 14 investigated VOCs and 6 metals.
- Sibling design on CP study:
  - "CPSIB_sampledata_Full.csv" contains aggregated statistics by birth years for major maternal demographic characteristic and prenatal factors among the full cohort.
  -  "CPSIB_sampledata_Sib.csv" contains aggregated statistics by birth years for major maternal demographic characteristic and prenatal factors among the sibling cohort.
